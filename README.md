# Graphene-Raman-Mathematica
A set of Mathematica programmes for fitting Raman spectra and maps of graphene

The following programmes are designed for the analysis of CVD graphene but may be easily altered to analyse maps of exfoliated graphene and other materials such as dyes, etc. 

### Motivation
Raman maps can contain thousands of spectra with varying backgrounds and peaks. Commercial software packages such as Origin are often unsuitable or inefficient for graphing such maps. 
This programme is much faster than any commercial programmes I have seen, which is very beneficial when analysing maps of numerous samples.

### Features
Fits the D, G, and 2D peaks, but can be easily edited to fit others.
Exports each fitted spectrum as a .png file.

Performs analysis such as identifying multilayer and strained areas, then exports 2D and 3D images.

Exports fitted histograms of the average (and enhanced) G peak area.

Designed to analyse surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) samples and is therefore quite robust when dealing with strongly varying peak intensities and backgrounds.
